As climate change continues to challenge the viability of current social arrangements[^1], we see more and more local communities being the ones to respond to more frequent and severe social and ecological crises. Their response will establish the basis through which new social structures emerge. By giving local decision-makers and community members the tools to better understand the complex social-ecological systems they embedded within, a more democratic and ecological world becomes possible. 

Hey, I am Jordan. I am currently a Master's student at OSU in the [School of Environment and Natural Resources](https://senr.osu.edu/) in the [Environmental Social Science](https://senr.osu.edu/graduate/environmental-social-sciences) program, studying  environmental policy and collaboration. My research interests are focused on policy diffusion and social network analysis. I am particularly interested in understanding the complex ways that human and natural systems shape each other and how communities can coordinate their policy design processes within the ecological systems they inhabit. 

I am a Columbus, Ohio native, currently living in Clintonville with my Wife, Maggie, and my cat, Edgar. Personally, I enjoy traveling to new places and experiencing new and diverse communities and ecosystems. In my free time, I can often be found reading, attempting to garden, or hiking with my friends and family. 

Areas of Interest: Policy Diffusion, Social-Ecological Systems, Collaborative Governance, Discourse Analysis, Pattern Language, Natural Language Processing, Social Network Analysis
